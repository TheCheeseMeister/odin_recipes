    <p>Here's a recipe on how to go about making a very epic pizza for the whole family.</p>

    <p>Before we get started, here's what you're gonna need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Yeast</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Bread Flour</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Now that we got that out of the way, here's the steps to making this fine dish:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Place warm water in a bowl. Add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until its creamy; around 10 mins.</li>
        <li>Add flour/oil/salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth by hand or with a standard mixer and dough hook.</li>
        <li>Let rest for 5 mins.</li>
        <li>I'm too lazy to do the rest... :)</li>
    </ol>
